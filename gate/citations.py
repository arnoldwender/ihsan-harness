"""The conduct-harness citation gate: every attributed quotation must trace to a source.

    python3 gate/citations.py              # offline checks
    python3 gate/citations.py --online     # also resolve every source URL
    python3 gate/citations.py --sarif out.json

Exit codes are part of the contract shared by the conduct-harness family:

    0   no findings
    1   findings — the repo makes a claim it cannot back
    2   the gate itself failed

The third one is not decoration. A checker that returns 1 when it crashed reads
as "I found something"; one that returns 0 reads as "clean" and fails OPEN —
which is the exact sin every codex in this family names as never tradeable.
This gate distinguishes its own failure from its verdict.

WHAT THIS GATE IS FOR
---------------------
`scripts/check.py` already verifies that a quotation printed in the README
exists somewhere in this repo. That catches a README quoting a line the emitter
never emits. It does NOT catch the failure that actually shipped: a quotation
that exists in the pool, is beautifully formatted, and is **not real** — wrong
work, wrong year, wrong author, wrong translator, or invented outright.

Four of the ten public harnesses shipped fabricated citations. Two dated
metadata errors got past every human reader:

  * "Sir Edwin Arnold, The Song Celestial (1885)" — Arnold was knighted in 1888,
    so the honorific is three years early.
  * Newton, "Principia (1687)", Rule I — in the 1687 edition that passage is
    *Hypothesis I*. It only becomes Regula I in the second edition of 1713.

Neither is catchable by grep. Both are catchable by arithmetic against the
author's dates and the edition history, which is what CHECK 3 does.

THIS FILE IS SHARED, ON PURPOSE
-------------------------------
It is the one piece of gate logic the conduct-harness repos hold in common.
Every other gate in the family is specific to the discipline its repo
automates; provenance is not — a fabricated citation is the same defect in
every tradition, so it gets one implementation rather than N drifting ones.
Nothing here names a particular repo: `CITED_FILES` lists the document names
used across the family and silently skips the ones a given repo does not have,
and the SARIF tool name is derived from the directory. Copy it verbatim.

A repo whose codex says "invent nothing" cannot ship a citation nobody can test.

    Three shapes carry an attribution in these repos, and only those three count.

    SHAPE A — a flowing blockquote, delimiter REQUIRED:

        > "…quotation…" — Author, Work (year)

    THE DELIMITER IS THE DISCRIMINANT HERE, and it was learned the hard way. The
    first version of this function treated "blockquote containing an em dash" as
    a citation, and fired on two lines of a repo's own prose:

        > The first utterance … from the empiricist canon — Bacon, Newton, Huxley.
        > Four pillars … — and every rule earns its place by carrying a way to
        > prove it broken.

    Both are prose that happens to contain an em dash. Neither is a quotation.
    A real citation in flowing text is always *delimited* — wrapped in quotation
    marks or in italics — because that is how a quotation is set off from the
    sentence around it. A gate with a 12% false-positive rate on its own README
    gets deleted in a week, and deserves to be.

    SHAPE B — a blockquote LIST ITEM, delimiter OPTIONAL:

        > - …quotation… — Author, Work (year)

    A bullet inside a blockquote is a list entry, not flowing prose, so the
    delimiter is not what tells the two apart and requiring it only creates
    blind spots. That is not a guess: measured 2026-09-10 across the four repos
    that carry this gate, EVERY `> - ` bullet containing an em dash is a
    citation and NONE is prose — 49 bullets, 49 citations, zero false positives.

    Requiring the delimiter here would have made the gate structurally blind to
    two entire pools, and blind in the quietest possible way: it would have
    reported "0 attributed quotations, clean, exit 0" over a repo whose eight
    haiku and eleven proverbs had never been checked at all. A gate that passes
    because it looked at nothing is worse than no gate, because it also issues
    a green badge. The Zen edition lists its haiku as undelimited bullets and
    the Ubuntu edition lists its proverbs the same way.

    SHAPE C — an attribution on its own line, attaching to the line above:

        > …quotation…
        > — Author (dates)

    This is the ordinary way a pull-quote is set in markdown, and all three
    non-empirical repos use it in the README. The attribution attaches to the
    immediately preceding non-empty blockquote line, which is exactly the line a
    reader's eye attaches it to. Measured: 5 occurrences across the family, 5
    genuine citations, no prose.

    A blockquote with no attribution at all is prose, not a citation, and
    demanding a source for it would make the gate fire on the repo's own
    writing. That distinction is the difference between a gate people keep and
    one they rip out.
