"""Mutation tests for the shared conduct-harness citation gate.

Every check gets the same treatment: build a repo that PASSES, then plant the
one defect that check exists to catch, and require the gate to go red. A test
that only ever sees a clean repo proves nothing — it would still pass if the
check were deleted.

    python3 -m pytest tests/ -q

The gate is invoked as a subprocess rather than imported, because the exit code
is part of the contract the whole conduct-harness family shares (0 clean,
1 findings, 2 the gate itself broke). Importing would test the functions and
leave the contract untested.
